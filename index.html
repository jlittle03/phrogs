    <!-- 
    Each week with new html/css/javascript assignments will go
    in the respective folder for the week, and you will link to
    the index.html of the project.

    What follows is an example of how you will add more links
    as you progress through the course. I added some simple styling
    to this page, we will learn about that later in the  course!

    Only the link to week 1 will work.

     -->

     <a href="Week_1/index.html">Week 1</a>

     <a href="Week_2/index.html">Week 2</a>

     <a href="Week_3/index.html">Week 3</a>

     <a href="Week_4/index.html">Week 4</a>
